We introduce MAC (Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality), a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of pre-trained multimodal models against adversarial text updates. Our study reveals that state-of-the-art vision-language models like CLIP are vulnerable to compositional adversarial attacks generated by LLMs, highlighting the need for more robust multimodal representations.
