In the rapidly evolving landscape of language, resolving new linguistic expressions in continuously updating knowledge bases remains a formidable challenge. This challenge becomes critical in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with knowledge bases, as emerging expressions hinder the retrieval of relevant documents, leading to generator hallucinations. We introduce a novel task aimed at resolving emerging mentions to dynamic entities and present DynamicER benchmark, including dynamic entity mention resolution and entity-centric knowledge-intensive QA task. We propose a temporal segmented clustering method with continual adaptation, effectively managing the temporal dynamics of evolving entities and emerging mentions.
