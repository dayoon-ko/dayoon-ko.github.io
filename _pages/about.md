Hi! I'm Dayoon Ko, a Ph.D. student in CSE at Seoul National university, advised by Gunhee Kim. My primary research interest lies in model evaluation for several challenges.  My research has focused on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and multimodal learning, emphasizing enhancing the scalability and adaptability of large language models (LLMs). Moving forward, I aim to apply RAG techniques to video-based LLMs, exploring how these models can integrate and process both text and video data for more effective understanding and generation.
